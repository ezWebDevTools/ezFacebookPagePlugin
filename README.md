#ezFacebookPagePlugin

A basic knockoff / rendition of the Facebook Page plugin / widget. 

Ref: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/page-plugin


####Please Note

- You'll have to use the FB JavaScript SDK to hook up any interactions (e.g., Like button).

- The CSS makes uses of a couple sprites via FB's CND. Obviously, those are subject to change.

- This is loosely based on Bootstrap 3.x, but could easily be refactored to your own needs. 


####"Why?" you ask.

In short, control. For a couple of reasons we wanted to render our own FB Pages' widget, specifically in WordPress.
